# Library-Management-System-With-Integraton
Integrated the smart contract with simple frontend where we can access and manipulate the data in blockchain

* In this we have created simple frontend and connected it with the smart conract of the Library management system which will make the interaction very easy for user.
* I have also connected the metamask for automatic chain ID identification and user wallet address for interaction with the smart contract.
